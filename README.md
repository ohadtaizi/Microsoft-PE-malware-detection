## windows Pe malware detection using Ensamble learning
-Malware detection is the process of ascertaining the presence of malware on a system or determining whether a program is malicious or harmless so that the system can be protected or recovered from any effects caused by the malicious code .<br>
As the number of legitimate users of the Internet increases, so do the opportunities for cybercriminals to gain from manufacturing malware.<br>
-This is the reason that prompted the authors of the [article](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9709/8/1/10) we investigated to develop a model for predicting whether a PE file is malicious or benign by methods of deep learning and group learning.<br>
-We implemented the idea in the models and tried to slightly improve the results, which we did manage to do eventually.<br>
-We used the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amauricio/pe-files-malwares/data) of the research from Kaggle.<br>
